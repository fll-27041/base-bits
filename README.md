# base-bits
Starter python code for First Lego League (FLL) robotics.  Virtual base-bits for physical base-bots!

## Getting Started

Are you an FLL coach who wants to help your team develop skills in python while avoiding long startup times, keep a record of code changes and have the ability to revert to known-good versions of the code, and leverage a modular system that allows teams to cleanly work on multiple missions?

1. Create a github account.  We suggest using a username of fll-{team_number}, where {team_number} is your FLL team id.  For example "fll-27041".  If the coach has a personal github account already, appending "+fll" to your email address (with gmail and other providers), allows you to keep accounts separate.

2. Install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github into VS Code.

3. Fork this base-bits project on github, creating your own copy (preferably with a better name than base-bits, such as fll-27041-superpowered).

4. Use the Visual Studio Command Pallete (Ctrl-Shift-P / Command-Shift-P) and choose Git Clone.  Paste in the URL from your new project.

5. Make some changes to the README.md in the root of the project.  Got to the Source Control panel (Ctrl-Shift-G) in VS Code and click "Commit".

6. Click "Sync Changes" to push to the remote branch.  You code is now shared on github.com with other team members.

7. Try a fast change by typing in a commit message then hitting Ctrl-Enter, Tab, Enter to push.
